# Vault for Android

An independent Android project from Wonderdesk by Rednave. This is the existing Android preview, not a full port of the former Linux application.

Vault stores credentials locally in an encrypted v2 format and can copy a username or password with Android's sensitive clipboard marker and best-effort clearing. The editor shows a local password-strength heuristic. **Independent security audit is still pending**; there is no password recovery, sync, or autofill.

## Build

Install JDK 17 or 21 and Android SDK 35, then set `ANDROID_HOME` or configure `sdk.dir` in an untracked `local.properties`. Run:

```sh
./gradlew :vault:assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is in `vault/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. It is not a production-signed release. Debug builds use your local Android debug key; they cannot update an existing installation signed with a different key. Back up any important app data before changing signing keys or uninstalling. The application ID is preserved from the Wonderdesk Android monorepo. `versions.json` is a local snapshot; change the relevant app version there when releasing. The catalog and ecosystem version under `shared/src/main/assets/wonderdesk/` are also snapshots, not a live service.

## Appearance

Aqua is the default. Open About to choose Aqua, Bliss, Dark Bliss, or Super and adjust motion independently in this app. Aqua and Super have ambient motion and tap bursts when Full motion and Android animations are enabled; Reduced uses smaller bursts with no ambient drift, and Off is still. Type now uses the owner's Bliss, Aqua and Super fonts (Dark Bliss uses the system font), dialogs are themed per look, and Aqua/Super show owner brand art in the header. These Compose adaptations are not yet exact ports of BlissPlayer's dialogs, click effects, or every control. Existing feature and platform limitations are described in the app's About screen. Artwork may still be temporary, but the launcher icon is owner-supplied (your SVG, rasterized in-repo).

The `shared` module is vendored so this repository builds without the monorepo or other Wonderdesk repositories. Changes to shared code must currently be propagated to the other repositories manually. Third-party license notices are in `shared/src/main/assets/licenses/`.

## Publishing privately
